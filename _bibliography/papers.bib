    abstract = {We present a method to generate all fusion rings of a specific rank and multiplicity. This method generated exhaustive lists of fusion rings up to order 9 for several multiplicities. We introduce a class of non-commutative fusion rings based on a group with transitive action on a set. This construction generalises the Tambara–Yamagami (TY) and Haagerup-Izumi (HI) fusion rings. We give an example of two such rings that are categorifiable and not of TY or HI type. The structure of non-commutative fusion rings with a subgroup is reviewed, and the one- and two-particle extensions of groups are classified. A website containing data on fusion rings is introduced, and an overview of a Wolfram Language package for working with these rings is given. We also applied several categorifiability criteria to the fusion rings. We provide a table of all multiplicity-free fusion rings up to rank 9 with info on the categorifiability of each ring.},

abstract={This thesis explains the methods and algorithms we used to obtain explicit 𝐹 symbols, 𝑅 symbols, and pivotal coefficients of all multiplicity-free pivotal fusion categories up to rank 7. The thesis starts by introducing the concept of a unitary modular fusion system via two applications: modeling anyons for topological quantum computation and calculating braid group representations. Next, the notions of a pivotal, spherical, braided, ribbon, and modular fusion system are introduced. These are arithmetic counterparts to fusion categories with the respective structure. Unitarity and its implications on the pivotal structure are discussed as well. The next part of the thesis is devoted to algorithms for finding fusion systems and compatible structures. First, an algorithm to find low-rank fusion rings is explained, and its results are given. Special attention is given to the structure of non-commutative fusion rings and the construction of songs, which are generalizations of the Tambara-Yamagami and Haagerup Izumi fusion rings, is given. Then, the algorithms used to find fusion systems are discussed. Particular attention is given to how the individual steps for solving the consistency equations are done with Anyonica, a software package we developed for working with fusion systems. Gauge and automorphism equivalence are reviewed, and algorithms that put solutions in a unitary gauge and remove redundant solutions are given. Some results on the categorification of all multiplicity-free pivotal fusion rings up to rank 7 are presented. The final part of the thesis is devoted to building models of anyons on graphs and how their behavior differs from those in the plane. The appendices contain a minimal mathematical exposition on fusion categories with their relation to fusion systems, a list of all multiplicity-free fusion rings up to rank 9 with information on categorifiability, a list of all multiplicity-free fusion categories up to rank 7, and data on some graph-braid models.},
