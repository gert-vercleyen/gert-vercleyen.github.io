A pdf file containing all lecture notes (including revision sessions) for MA266 Fall 2025 can be downloaded [here](/assets/pdf/allnotes.pdf). Any resemblance between these notes and any lectures given at Purdue during spring 2026 is nonexistent and a product of your imagination. Any resemblance to these notes to certain textbooks sold (or rented out) for a lot of money by a certain company providing certain expensive online services are taken as a grave insult towards my notes. 

Below you may also find some stuff I scrambled down for no reason whatsoever. Only a fool would think these are proper notes and I am not responsible for any mistakes, math related PTSD, accidental summoning of demons, breaking of relationships, spiritual transformations, or any other side effects these notes might have.
