# About me

My research focuses on finding and probing properties of (multiplicity-free) fusion categories. To do so I develop software using computational algebra to solve consistency equations arising from commutative diagrams. The data obtained this way is collected as part of packages such as [Anyonica](https://github.com/gert-vercleyen/Anyonica) and, since recently,  [TensorCategories.jl](https://github.com/FabianMaeurer/TensorCategories.jl). I aim to make as much data available online as well on the [AnyonWiki](https://anyonwiki.github.io/).

My main goal is to have a central repository of computational (yet readable) data on fusion categories that is free, open-source, accessible, user friendly for both mathematicians and physicists.

At the moment, the [AnyonWiki](https://anyonwiki.github.io/) contains
* The $F$-symbols, $R$-symbols, and pivotal coefficients of all multiplicity-free fusion categories up to rank 7. All data is downloadable in numerical format and also available symbolically as part of the [Anyonica](https://github.com/gert-vercleyen/Anyonica) and, more recently, [TensorCategories.jl](https://github.com/FabianMaeurer/TensorCategories.jl) packages.
* A list of all multiplicity-free fusion rings up to rank 9 together with downloadable data of their most important properties, such as Frobenius-Perron dimensions, $S$-matrices, characters, decompositions, etc
* Pages on classes of fusion rings corresponding to certain quantum groups.

Take a look at my current [projects](/al-folio/projects) page to learn more about the future plans for the wiki.

# Posters
I like being creative with my research posters. In particular, I love to combine the topics I'm researching with other media I'm engaging with.
The poster on fusion rings is inspired by The Lord of The Rings, my favorite childhood books and movies. The poster on fusion categories is based on the Doom video games I was playing during my PhD.

Both posters were created with the free and open source application Inkscape.

The images shown below are of limited quality but you can download the pdf files here
* [Fusion Rings Poster](/assets/img/PosterFusionRings.pdf)
* [Fusion Categories Poster](/assets/img/Doom.pdf)

Note that (especially for the fusion categories poster) it might take some time for your pdf viewer to load the whole image.
