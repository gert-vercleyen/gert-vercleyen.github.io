Here you can find some of my current projects.

* **Implementing Anyonica's functionality in julia**. Anyonica has a huge number of useful functions for dealing with fusion categories and equations arising when computing properties
of these categories. It is a Mathematica package, however, which is non-free, closed source, and yes, slow when it comes to symbolic algebra. Therefore, I am implementing the current functionality of Anyonica in julia (with [OSCAR](https://www.oscar-system.org/)). The first part of the project, a fusion rings package [FusionRings.jl](https://github.com/gert-vercleyen/FusionRings.jl ) is under development with Sami Nasser Zagha.
* **Expanding the capabilities of the AnyonWiki**. Currently the Anyonwiki is a collection of text pages and data generated by exporting text files with Anyonica. We're working on a next version of the wiki that contains a proper SQL database of fusion rings and categories that allows for an advanced search function. We're also in the progress of storing all the data on fusion rings and categories in a format that can easily be imported by multiple packages such as SAGE, OSCAR, Mathematica.
